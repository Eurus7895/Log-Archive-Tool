# Log-Archive-Tool
The tool will archive logs on a set schedule by compressing them and storing them in a new directory, this is especially useful for removing old logs and keeping the system clean while maintaining the logs in a compressed format for future reference

This repository is created to finish the project from https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool
